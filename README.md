# Covid19-Detection-DeepLearning
Combined my background in Medical Biochemistry with Deep Learning to build a Lung Classification Model. Using TensorFlow/Keras, I developed a CNN capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from normal lung scans with high probability precision. It includes a clinical interpretation layer to assist in diagnostic decision-making.
